###DNA quantification, etc. w/ Sam
- steps to figure out degree of methylation
  1. Collect tissue sample
  2. add buffers, enzymes, turn into soup
  3. centrifuge/elution to isolate DNA
  4. quantify DNA (how much DNA is actually in your sample?)
    1. by measuring many solutions w/ range of DNA against range of standards (think spectrophotometry)
    2. there's another more precise method, can't recall
  5. add chemical that turns methylated C's into another base (T's? forgot)
  6. send for sequencing
  7. compare to published genome of organism (cpg ratio)
- a lot of it is figuring out the kits and the knacks of the machines
