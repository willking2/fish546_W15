# Week 3 progress

- Tues: met up with class
  - talked to Sam about running commands using full paths, and in IPython
  - set up Hummingbird, thanks to JH for help
- Wed: figured out how to download uniprot data into hummingbird 
  - $curl with -o, thanks to SR and SW for help
  - ran blastx in Hummingbird!
- Thurs: there's a blastx .tab output file in hummingbird (~/srlab/willbigdata/Nlap_uniprot_blastx.tab)
  - hopefully it's a complete one
