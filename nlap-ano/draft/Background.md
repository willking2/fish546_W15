Organisms respond to stressors in its environment at behavioral, physiological, cellular, and molecular scales. One way to examine how an organism copes with its environment is to investigate the proteins that it produces.

In this project, I annotated the transcriptome of the dogwhelk, *Nucella lapillus*, with corresponding protein names and functions. I also created datasets containing only proteins relevant to stress response and analyzed the percent of proteins transcribed that relate to stress response. 

*N. lapillus* is a predatory whelk (also known as Atlantic dogwinkles) that resides in the intertidal zone. They are common in the North Atlantic. As intertidal organisms, they are subject to a variety of environmental stressors, including strong temperature and salinity changes. The *N. lapillus* transcriptome is published and available (Chu et al. 2014), making it a suitable organism for transcriptome annotation in this project.
