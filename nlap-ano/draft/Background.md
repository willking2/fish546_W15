Organisms respond to stressors in the environment at behavioral, physiological, cellular, and molecular scales. One way to examine how an organism copes with its environment is to investigate the proteins that it produces.

*Nucella lapillus* is a predatory whelk (also known as Atlantic dogwinkle) that resides in the intertidal zone. As intertidal organisms, they are subject to a variety of environmental stressors, including strong temperature and salinity changes. 

In this project, I annotated the transcriptome of *N. lapillus. The *N. lapillus* transcriptome is published and available (Chu et al. 2014). I created datasets of *N. Lapillus* contigs with corresponding protein names and functions. I also created datasets containing only proteins relevant to stress response and analyzed the percent of proteins transcribed that relate to stress response. 

I created these datasets as a resource for future use. I hope to utilize these datasets in future research on the ecological responses of intertidal invertebrates to temperature change. The datasets generated from this project may also be of use to to others interested in the physiological stress response of a marine snail.
